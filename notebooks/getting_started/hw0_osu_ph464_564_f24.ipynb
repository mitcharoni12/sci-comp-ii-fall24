    "## Problem 1\n",
    "If you are not familiar with `git`/GitHub please look at the README in this directory _first_, make a GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, we are going to finish setting up git and practice your git and GitHub skills by submitting this homework via GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You'll need to setup some security protocols since the class repository and your repository will be private. You need to choose whether you would like to use security tokens or `ssh` and follow the appropriate section of this [tutorial](https://www.wwwinsights.com/webinfra/git/clone-a-github-private-repository/). _I recommend setting up the ssh!_ \n",
    "\n",
    "This will likely require you to set up two-factor authentication through DUO :-(\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Navigate to https://github.com/oregonstate-physics/sci-comp-ii-fall24 on your browser. **Don't clone this!** Instead, look to the rop right of the page for an option to fork the repository. Do this now. This will make a copy of the class repository for your own personal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Now that you have a fork of the repository, clone it to your machine. I suggest making a larger directory named `/ph464_fall2024/` or something like that. There will be at least one more repository in the folder. *Note: The below url will look slightly different if you are using tokens. Make sure to click https for tokens or ssh for ssh in the clone pull down menu.*\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sci-comp-ii-fall24.git \n",
    "```\n",
    "4) Add the original `oregonstate-physics` repository as an `upstream` repository to your fork. First, list the current configured remote repository for your fork with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, add the `oregonstate-physics` repo as an upstream:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/oregonstate-physics/sci-comp-ii-fall24\n",
    "```\n",
    "Verify that the new repository shows as an `upstream` by running `git remote -v` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Now add a directory calling `/working/` to your repository and copy, **don't delete**, this notebook into the working directory. For this assignment this will seem unnecessary. In the future you will want to copy any notebook, whether the one looked at during class, or the homework, to this directory so that you will have your own copy to \"mess around with\" without getting in the way of updates that I might make that you will need to pull from the `upstream` directory. Commit these changes.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git add working/\n",
    "    $ git commit -a -m \"adding working directory\"\n",
    "    $ git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Get used to syncing upstream content to your fork with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git fetch upstream\n",
    "    $ git checkout main\n",
    "    $ git merge upstream/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "    **This will be how you update the code in your local repository as I tweak future assignments. **\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Now go to your GitHub page and find the `+` button in the upper right corner and add a new repository. Name the repo whatever you'd like, but something like `scientific_computing_work_fal2024` would be appropriate. Choose the repo to be **private**, use no template and don't add any extras (README, license or whatnot). \n",
    "\n",
    "8) Add me as a collaborator to your repo. Go to the repo and click on the settings (gear in upper right/middle). Go to Collaborators and Teams (top on the LHS) and click Add People. My username is `Hazboun6`. Make me a `Maintainer`. You can revoke my access when the class is over ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Clone your repo locally and add a folder named `work`. Copy _this file_ from the class repo into that folder and commit it. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git add /work\n",
    "    $ git commit -a -m \"adding first assignment\"\n",
    "    $ git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Join the class Slack workspace using this [link](). Send me a message in Slack that has the url of your repo. It will look something like\n",
    "```  \n",
    "    $  https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/scientific_computing_work_fal2024\n",
    "```\n",
    "    I will add your repository as a `submodule` which allows your repo to remain private, except to you and me, while the class repo will be public. \n",
    "\n",
    "11) In the future copy your completed lecture notebooks (with all exercises finished) to your folder. This is what you will do for each week's lecture notebooks to get participation credit. Your lecture notebooks should have already been copies of my base lecture notebooks. **Never** run my base notebooks; always make a personal copy for yourself."

    "Here we will set up your coding environment for the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Editor \n",
    "\n",
    "There a number of different ways to interact with the code in this class. If you choose to use the Jupyter Hub provided by OSU through Canvas, then you will be using Jupyter notebooks to do your coding. Most of the course is written as Jupyter notebooks, so this is a great native choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on my laptop. Jupyter notebooks run natively, with the correct extensions, inside of `VSCode` and you can additionally setup the work environment as a Docker image within VSCode. (More on that later!)\n",

    "### Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Jupyter Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "Log in to the Jupyter Hub through the Canvas resources module. You can use the command line to `git clone` your repo and the class repo and do all of the classwork there.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: `devcontainer` / Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) then when you open it up it will prompt you to start a dev conatiner since the scripts exist in the repo for one  to be built. It will also prompt you to download `Docker`. This is what builds the conatiner and mounts the repo into the conatiner so that the software can run in the dev environment. This is a very good option if you are interesed in running the class code with a Windows machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3: Conda\n",
    "You can also use a software management system to install the code needed for this class. Here I have included instructions for [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your python environment (which plays nicely with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).  Follow the instructions to install miniconda, which will set you up with the `conda` command line tool for managing your environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can also use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html), which is a faster, next generation version of the `conda` software. **Beware** that the commands will be slightly different than below!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `requirements.txt` in this repository to set up an environment with the packages we need.  To do so, open a terminal window, navigate to the base directory of the repository, and run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n scicomp python=3.10 pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an environment called `scicomp` running python version 3.10, with `pip` installed.  Now activate that environment and install the required packages within it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate scicomp\n",
